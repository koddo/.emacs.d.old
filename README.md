# Clojure Mode

Provides Emacs font-lock, indentation, and navigation for the
[Clojure programming language](http://clojure.org).

More thorough walkthroughs are available at
[clojure-doc.org](http://clojure-doc.org/articles/tutorials/emacs.html)
and [Clojure for the Brave and the True](http://www.braveclojure.com/basic-emacs/).

## Installation

Available on all major `package.el` community maintained repos -  [MELPA Stable][],
[MELPA][] and [Marmalade][] repos.

MELPA Stable and Marmalade are recommended as they have the latest stable version.
MELPA has a development snapshot for users who don't mind breakage but
don't want to run from a git checkout.

You can install `clojure-mode` using the following command:

<kbd>M-x package-install [RET] clojure-mode [RET]</kbd>

or if you'd rather keep it in your dotfiles:

```el
(unless (package-installed-p 'clojure-mode)
  (package-install 'clojure-mode))
```

If the installation doesn't work try refreshing the package list:

<kbd>M-x package-refresh-contents</kbd>

### Extra font-locking

Prior to version 3.0 `clojure-mode` bundled **unreliable**
font-locking for some built-in vars.  In 3.0 this was extracted from
`clojure-mode` and moved to a separate package -
[clojure-mode-extra-font-locking][].

## Configuration

To see a list of available configuration options do `M-x customize-group RET clojure`.

### Indentation options

The default indentation rules in `clojure-mode` are derived from the
[community Clojure Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/clojure-style-guide).
Please, refer to the guide for the general Clojure indentation rules.

The indentation of special forms and macros with bodies is controlled via
`put-clojure-indent`, `define-clojure-indent` and `clojure-backtracking-indent`.
Nearly all special forms and built-in macros with bodies have special indentation
settings in `clojure-mode`. You can add/alter the indentation settings in your
personal config. Let's assume you want to indent `->>` and `->` like this:

```clojure
(->> something
  ala
  bala
  portokala)
```

You can do so by putting the following in your config:

```el
(put-clojure-indent '-> 1)
(put-clojure-indent '->> 1)
```

This means that the body of the `->/->>` is after the first argument.

A more compact way to do the same thing is:

```el
(define-clojure-indent
  (-> 1)
  (->> 1))
```

The bodies of certain more complicated macros and special forms
(e.g. `letfn`, `deftype`, `extend-protocol`, etc) are indented using
a contextual backtracking indentation method, controlled by
`clojure-backtracking-indent`. Here's some example config code:

```el
(put 'implement 'clojure-backtracking-indent '(4 (2)))
(put 'letfn 'clojure-backtracking-indent '((2) 2))
(put 'proxy 'clojure-backtracking-indent '(4 4 (2)))
(put 'reify 'clojure-backtracking-indent '((2)))
(put 'deftype 'clojure-backtracking-indent '(4 4 (2)))
(put 'defrecord 'clojure-backtracking-indent '(4 4 (2)))
(put 'defprotocol 'clojure-backtracking-indent '(4 (2)))
(put 'extend-type 'clojure-backtracking-indent '(4 (2)))
(put 'extend-protocol 'clojure-backtracking-indent '(4 (2)))
(put 'specify 'clojure-backtracking-indent '(4 (2)))
(put 'specify! 'clojure-backtracking-indent '(4 (2)))
```

Don't use special indentation settings for forms with names that are not unique,
as `clojure-mode`'s indentation engine is not namespace-aware and you might
end up getting strange indentation in unexpected places.

Please, see the docstrings of the Emacs Lisp functions/vars noted above for
information about customizing this indentation behavior.

## Related packages

* [clojure-mode-extra-font-locking][] provides additional font-locking
for built-in methods and macros.  The font-locking is pretty
imprecise, because it doesn't take namespaces into account and it
won't font-lock a function at all possible positions in a sexp, but
if you don't mind its imperfections you can easily enable it:

```el
(require 'clojure-mode-extra-font-locking)
```

The code in `clojure-mode-font-locking` used to be bundled with
`clojure-mode` before version 3.0.

You can also use the code in this package as a basis for extending the
font-locking further (e.g. functions/macros from more
namespaces). Generally you should avoid adding special font-locking
for things that don't have fairly unique names, as this will result in
plenty of incorrect font-locking.

* [clj-refactor][] provides refactoring support.

* Enabling `CamelCase` support for editing commands(like
`forward-word`, `backward-word`, etc) in `clojure-mode` is quite
useful since we often have to deal with Java class and method
names. The built-in Emacs minor mode `subword-mode` provides such
functionality:

```el
(add-hook 'clojure-mode-hook #'subword-mode)
```

* The use of [paredit][] when editing Clojure (or any other Lisp) code
is highly recommended. It helps ensure the structure of your forms is
not compromised and offers a number of operations that work on code
structure at a higher level than just characters and words. To enable
it for Clojure buffers:

```el
(add-hook 'clojure-mode-hook #'paredit-mode)
```

* [smartparens][] is an excellent
  (newer) alternative to paredit. Many Clojure hackers have adopted it
  recently and you might want to give it a try as well. To enable
  `smartparens` use the following code:

```el
(add-hook 'clojure-mode-hook #'smartparens-strict-mode)
```

* [RainbowDelimiters][] is a
  minor mode which highlights parentheses, brackets, and braces
  according to their depth. Each successive level is highlighted in a
  different color. This makes it easy to spot matching delimiters,
  orient yourself in the code, and tell which statements are at a
  given depth. Assuming you've already installed `RainbowDelimiters` you can
  enable it like this:

```el
(add-hook 'clojure-mode-hook #'rainbow-delimiters-mode)
```

## REPL Interaction

A number of options exist for connecting to a running Clojure process
and evaluating code interactively.

### Basic REPL

Install [inf-clojure][] for basic interaction with a REPL process.

### CIDER

You can also use [Leiningen][] to start an
enhanced REPL via [CIDER][].
